Sorting by exchange or sorting by bubble is a simple sorting algorithm The algorithm works in this way in the given data set list or array two neighboring elements are compared If one of the elements does not meet the sorting criterion is larger or conversely smaller than its neighbor then these two elements change places The passage through the list goes on until the data is sorted out The algorithm got its name from the fact that the process of sorting on it resembles the behavior of air bubbles in a reservoir with water Since it only uses comparisons to handle array elements it is comparative sorting
The complexity of the algorithm in the worst case in the average case is equal where n is the number of elements for sorting There are many much more efficient algorithms for example with the worst performance equal to n log n Therefore this algorithm has low efficiency in cases where N is quite large except for rare specific cases when it is known in advance that the array will be well sorted from the beginningSorting by exchange or sorting by bubble is a simple sorting algorithm The algorithm works in this way in the given data set list or array two neighboring elements are compared If one of the elements does not meet the sorting criterion is larger or conversely smaller than its neighbor then these two elements change places The passage through the list goes on until the data is sorted out The algorithm got its name from the fact that the process of sorting on it resembles the behavior of air bubbles in a reservoir with water Since it only uses comparisons to handle array elements it is comparative sorting
